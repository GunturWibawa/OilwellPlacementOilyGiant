I need to find a suitable location to dig a new oilwell. Here are the steps to select a new location:\n","\n","- Collect parameters to build oilwells in selected areas: the oil quality and the volume of oil reserves;\n","- Create a model that can predict the volume of oil reserves in new wells;\n","- Choose the oilwell with the highest estimated value;\n","- Select the region with the highest total profit for the selected oilwells.\n","\n","I have oil sample data from three regions. The parameters of each oilwell in the area were already known. Create a model that will help to select the territories with the highest profit margins. Perform an analysis of potential profits and risks using bootstrapping techniques."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"duBANEREOpMu"},"source":["# Project Instructions\n","\n","1.
