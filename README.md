The project assigned to me during the ninth sprint involves Machine Learning within the domain of Business.

Throughout this sprint, I acquired expertise in identifying essential business metrics, orchestrating A/B testing, employ bootstrapping methodologies, and data annotation.

# **Project Insight**

During this endeavor, I collaborated with a petroleum mining enterprise known as OilyGiant. My responsibilities encompassed the discovery of precise locations for the excavation of new oil wells. In doing so, I engineered a model designed to pinpoint zones yielding the maximum profit margins. I evaluate thoroughly the prospective earnings and associated risks, leveraging bootstrapping techniques.

Through careful observation, I derived several key insights:

1. A well must contain a volume of oil exceeding 112 thousand barrels to render its investment financially viable.
2. On average, 20 million of the total 100 million data points across the three regions meet the criteria for potential development.
3. If the foremost 200 wells in each region are developed, the maximum profit, totaling nearly 40 million USD, will be achieved in Region 1.
4. Investing in the top 200 wells across the three regions will ensure profitability to each.
5. Region 0 is distinguished by the highest profitability.
6. Moreover, Region 0 exhibits the most significant number of points surpassing the threshold of 112.

Following a comprehensive analysis and the creation of the predictive model, a summary of the project is as follows:

The outcome of this project is a predictive model capable of assessing the volume of oil reserves within a well, fostering the optimism that the capital deployed will reap financial benefits. According to the predictions drawn from the model, Region 2 hosts the most abundant average oil reserves. To turn a profit, an oil well must contain at least 112 thousand barrels of oil reserves.

Upon conducting the bootstrapping process, I see that investment in Region 2 harbors a higher degree of risk along with the most modest average income in comparison to the other two regions. Consequently, I advocate for investment in Region 1, as it presents the most favorable balance of minimal risk and maximum profit.
